# Census of Governments Data Merge

The code in this repository can be used to extract, align, and merge data from the U.S. Census of Governments surveys of
local government finance and employment, for any U.S. places (e.g. all or specific municipalities, school districts, etc.)
and any years from 1972 to 2015. The historic files have different formats and variable composition than the newer files,
such that considerable variable mapping and imputation of parts to totals is necessary to produce comparable time series data.

The data files referenced are available through the U.S. Census Bureau website, and may be subject to change. To use the
code with available census files, I provide instructions in the document downloadingdata.txt regarding what to download
and where it was located at the time this was written. (This is an unaffiliated project; the code was originally created
for a study at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley.)
