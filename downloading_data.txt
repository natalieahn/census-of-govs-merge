The main historic data files were publicly available at the following locations at the time of writing.
(Note: This is an unaffiliated project; the data files are owned and maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau and may be subject to change.)

1972 - 2010 (Finance), 1972 - 2012 (Employment):
https://www2.census.gov/pub/outgoing/govs/special60/
_IndEmp1972-2010.zip
_IndFin_1967-2012.zip

Unzip both files into the directory containing the files in repo, or revise the filepath "cog_dir" in cog_merge.py to the location
where you've downloaded the Census of Governments data files.

2011 - 2015 (Finance):
https://www.census.gov/govs/local/historical_data.html

It should be possible to download individual data files for each of the most recent years from this site.
Select the desired year from the drop-down menu under "1992 - 2015". (E.g. 2015 takes you to the latest year data at
https://www.census.gov/govs/local/; 2014 takes you to https://www.census.gov//govs/local/historical_data_2014.html
at the time this was written.)

On each year page, toward the bottom of the main box under Downloadable Data, click on "Individual Unit File - Public Use Format",
or the closest option for individual unit files, to obtain the full dataset broken down by city/county/district/etc. (E.g. for 2015,
this link should initiate downloading the file https://www2.census.gov/govs/local/2015_Individual_Unit_file.zip; for 2014,
https://www2.census.gov/govs/local/2014_Individual_Unit_File_Revised.zip, etc.)

Unzip these files to a directory labeled FinanceDataFiles_2013-2014 within this repo directory (or revise the filepath in cog_merge.py).
Within FinanceDataFiles_2013-2014, there should be a subdirectory called "2015_Individual_Unit_File" containing the 2015 data files.
Check all filenames within these directories to ensure that they match the filenames in cog_merge.py, or revise the code file accordingly.

2013 - 2016 (Employment):
https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/apes/data/datasets.html

The Employment data files for recent years now appear to be accessible from this page; the 2016 link provides a single zip file for All
Available Data (https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/apes/datasets/2016/annual-apes/2016_downloadable_data.zip), inside of which
are the 16empid.txt and 16empst.txt files used in the cog_merge.py code. You will probably need to change the directory names
either in your file structure after unzipping, or in the relevant filepaths in cog_merge.py.

General Note:
Individual files may change names or locations, and new years may be added, but with different formats or variable names.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the code or files in this repo, or how to make them work with current
Census of Governments data files.
